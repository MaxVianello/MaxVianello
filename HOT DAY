LETTER


Today is very hot.
I'll go for a swim in a waterpool.
I've been in a Rio in the mountains and the water was too cold, but i went in with thw whole body for 10 seconds.
I like playing tennis, doing athletics and i love running.
Today I've completed a work of mine in wood: a safe.
I really like eating Gelato (IceCream)
I wont be alone for the next 3 years because I falled in love with a girl.
I wont leave my friends alone because I love them.
What is going up to you?
I'm very interested on that.
Where do you live?

bye, bye
